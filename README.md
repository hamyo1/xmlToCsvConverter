# XML to CSV Converter

This project is a generic XML to CSV converter that transforms any XML files with a consistent structure into a CSV format. The converter extracts the necessary information based on the provided XML structure and generates corresponding CSV rows.

## Features

- Supports multiple XML files.
- Adapts to various XML structures, as long as they are consistent.
- Outputs structured data in CSV format.

## Input Example

The input XML file can have any xml structure the code is generic:

```
for example here is xml input and output csv

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Root>
    <Title>secondDoc</Title>
    <customers>
        <groupNumber>4</groupNumber>
        <groupId>4</groupId>
        <customer>
            <name>Charter Group</name>
            <address>
                <addres>
                    <street>100 Main</street>
                    <city>Framingham</city>
                    <state>MA</state>
                    <zip>01701</zip>
                </addres>
                <addres>
                    <street>720 Prospect</street>
                    <state>MA</state>
                    <zip>01701</zip>
                </addres>
            </address>
            <id>
                <value>1</value>
            </id>
        </customer>
        <customer>
            <name>Charter Group2</name>
            <address>
                <addres>
                    <street>100 Main2</street>
                    <city>Framingham2</city>
                    <state>MA2</state>
                    <zip>017012</zip>
                </addres>
                <addres>
                    <street>720 Prospect2</street>
                    <city>Framingham</city>
                    <state>MA</state>
                    <zip>01701</zip>
                </addres>
            </address>
            <id>
                <value>2</value>
            </id>
        </customer>
    </customers>
</Root>
```

## Output Example

The output will be a CSV file structured as follows:

```
Title,groupNumber,groupId,name,street,city,state,zip,value,
secondDoc,4,4,Charter Group,100 Main,Framingham,MA,01701,1,
secondDoc,4,4,Charter Group,720 Prospect,,MA,01701,1,
secondDoc,4,4,Charter Group2,100 Main2,Framingham2,MA2,017012,2,
secondDoc,4,4,Charter Group2,720 Prospect2,Framingham,MA,01701,2,
```

## How It Works

1. **XML Parsing**: The program reads the XML files and uses an XML parser to extract the necessary information, including titles, customer details, and addresses.
  
2. **Data Structuring**: The converter dynamically determines the structure based on the input XML file, allowing it to adapt to various formats as long as they share a consistent layout.
  
3. **CSV Generation**: The extracted data is written to a CSV file with appropriate headers, ensuring each relevant entry is included in separate rows.

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## Usage

Run the converter by executing the main script, providing the XML file(s) as input:

```bash
python xml_to_csv_converter.py input1.xml input2.xml ...
```
